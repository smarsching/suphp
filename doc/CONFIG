Configuration
-------------

1. General notes

The suPHP configuration file resides in $sysconfdir/suphp.conf (which will
resolve e.g. to /etc/suphp.conf).

It has the usual "INI-file" syntax.

Section names are encapsulated in square brackets (e.g. [global]).
Configuration options are key value pairs, separated by a "=" sign (e.g.
umask=0077).

Comment lines start with a ";".

You can find a sample configuration in suphp.conf-example


2. Global options

This options have to be specified in the [global] section.
All this options are facultative.

  Defaults to "info".

webserver_user:
  Username of UID webserver is running as. If not specified, the
  compile-time value is used.

  especially when check_vhost_docroot is disabled. Defaults to / thus
  allowing scripts in any location being run.

  Is disabled by default:
  WARNING: Enabling this option is dangerous!

check_vhost_docroot:
  Checks wheter the script is within DOCUMENT_ROOT specified by the 
  webserver. This option is intended to avoid symbol links outside of the
  webpage directory. You may want to disable it, when you are using
  mod_vhost_alias or the Alias-directive.
  This option is disabled by default, if at compile-time the
  "--disable-check-docroot" option has been specified, otherwise it is

min_gid:

  Defaults to compile-time value.


3. Handlers

In the [handlers] section you specify a mapping between mime-types and
interpreters to be used.

Example:
x-httpd-php=php:/usr/bin/php

The "key" is the mime-type. The "value" consists of to parts seperated by a
colon.

The first part is the "mode". The second part is the path to the
interpreter.

At the moment two modes are supported:

"php"-mode: Use this mode for PHP scripts. Specify the PHP-interpreter you
  want to use.

"execute"-mode: Must be specified as "execute:!self". Does not take any
  interpreter as the script itself is executed. Use this option for
  CGI-scripts.
