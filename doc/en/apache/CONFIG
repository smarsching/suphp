Configuration
-------------

mod_suphp knows two configuration directives:

suPHP_Engine (can either be turned "on" or "off")

This option tells mod_suphp if a PHP-script requested on this server (or
VirtualHost) should be run with the PHP-interpreter or returned to the
browser "as it is".

This directive can be used in the global context or in a
"<VirtualHost>"-directive.


suPHP_ConfigPath (expects a path name)

This option tells mod_suphp which path to pass on to the PHP-interpreter
(by setting the PHPRC environment variable).
Do *NOT* refer to a file but to the directory the file resists in.

E.g.: If you want to use "/path/to/server/config/php.ini", use "suPHP_Config
/path/to/server/config".

If you don't use this option, PHP will use its compiled in default path.


suPHP_UserGroup (expects user- and groupname)

* Only supported when compiled with setid-mode "force" or "paranoid" *
Specify the user- and groupname to run PHP-scripts with.
Example: suPHP_UserGroup foouser bargroup
