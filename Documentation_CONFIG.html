Configuration
-------------

1. General notes

The suPHP configuration file resides in $sysconfdir/suphp.conf (which will
resolve e.g. to /etc/suphp.conf).

It has the usual "INI-file" syntax.

Section names are encapsulated in square brackets (e.g. [global]).
Configuration options are key value pairs, separated by a "=" sign (e.g.
umask=0077).

Comment lines start with a ";".

You can find a sample configuration in suphp.conf-example


2. Multiple values and escaping

For a setting that allows multiple values, you can either seperate the
values using the colon (":") character or you can use multiple lines.
If you use multiple lines any line following the first has to use the "+="
assignment, otherwise preceding values will be discarded.

If you want to use the ":" character in a value, you have to escape it
using a backslash ("\"). The backslash itself is escaped by prepending
another backslash.

For patterns the asterisk ("*") has to be escaped, too.


3. Variables

Certain configuration values may contain variables. Valid variables are:

${USERNAME}  - is replaced by the name of the target user
${UID}       - is replaced by the numerical UID of the target user
${GROUPNAME} - is replaced by the name of the target group
${GID}       - is replaced by the numerical GID of the target group
${HOME}      - is replaced by the path to the home directory of the target user

Dollar ("$") characters that are not meant to represent variables, have to
be escape using a backslash ("\"), if used in a value that allows 
variables.


4. Global options

This options have to be specified in the [global] section.
All this options are facultative.

logfile:
  Specifies path to logfile. If not specified, the compile-time value is
  used.

loglevel:
  One of "info", "warn", "error", "none".
  Specifies messages of which classification should be logged.
  Defaults to "info".

webserver_user:
  Username of UID webserver is running as. If not specified, the
  compile-time value is used.

docroot:
  Patterns matching all allowed script directories. This is an 
  additional security check, especially when 
  check_vhost_docroot is disabled. Defaults to "/*" thus
  allowing scripts in any location being run. May contain the 
  "*" character which matches zero to n characters excluding 
  the "/" character. Multiple values are allowed for this 
  setting. May contain variables as described above.

chroot:
  Path to change the process's root directory to before executing the
  script. Has to be specified without a trailing slash.
  If not specified, no chroot() call is performed. May contain variables
  as described above.

allow_file_group_writeable:
  Allow files to be group writeable. Is disabled by default.

allow_directory_group_writeable:
  Allow directories scripts are residing in to be group writeable.
  Is disabled by default.

allow_file_others_writeable:
  Allow files to be writeable by world. Is disabled by default:
  WARNING: Enabling this option is very dangerous and causes major
  security issues, especially the danger of arbitrary code execution!

allow_directoy_others_writeable:
  Allow directories scripts are residing in to be writeable by world.
  Is disabled by default:
  WARNING: Enabling this option is dangerous!

check_vhost_docroot:
  Checks wheter the script is within DOCUMENT_ROOT specified by the 
  webserver. This option is intended to avoid symbol links outside of the
  webpage directory. You may want to disable it, when you are using
  mod_vhost_alias or the Alias-directive.
  This option is disabled by default, if at compile-time the
  "--disable-check-docroot" option has been specified, otherwise it is
  enabled by default.

errors_to_browser:
  Enable this option to sent information about minor problems during script
  invocation to the browser. This option is disabled by default.

env_path:
  Content of the "PATH" environment variable. Set this to a safe value.
  The value has to be enclosed in quotes or colons have to be escaped with
  the backslash character.
  The default value is "/bin:/usr/bin".

umask:
  umask to set before script execution.
  Has to be specified in octal notation (e.g. 0077).

min_uid:
  Minimum UID allowed to execute scripts.
  Defaults to compile-time value.

min_gid:
  Minimum GID allowed to execute scripts.
  Defaults to compile-time value.


5. Handlers

In the [handlers] section you specify a mapping between mime-types and
interpreters to be used.

Example:
x-httpd-php=php\:/usr/bin/php

The "key" is the mime-type. The "value" consists of to parts seperated by a
colon. This colon has to be escaped by a backslash if the value is not 
enclosed by quotes.

The first part is the "mode". The second part is the path to the
interpreter.

At the moment two modes are supported:

"php"-mode: Use this mode for PHP scripts. Specify the PHP-interpreter you
  want to use.

"execute"-mode: Must be specified as "execute:!self". Does not take any
  interpreter as the script itself is executed. Use this option for
  CGI-scripts.
